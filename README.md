# AQI-TUTIEMPO-WEATHERMAP

1. THIS APP IS DEPLOYED IN https://aqi-tutiempo-weathermap.herokuapp.com/
2. IT PREDICTS PM2.5(mixture of solid and liquid particles that are suspended in the air) BY TAKING SOME PARAMETERS LIKE:
    T:Average Temperature(°C)
    TM:Maximum temperature(°C)
    Tm:Minimum temperature(°C)
    SLP:Atmospheric pressure at sea level(hPa)
    H:Average relative humidity(%)
    V V:Average visibility (Km)
    V:Average wind speed (Km/h)
    VM:Maximum sustained wind speed(Km/h).
3. DATA HAS BEEN COLLECTED FROM TUTIEMPO AND WETHWEMAP WEBSITE.
4. I JUST TRIED TO PREDICT IT FOR BANGALORE LOCATION ("INDIA") THAT CAN FURTHER BE IMPROVED.
6. I USED MANY MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHMS LIKE :
    LINEAR REGRESSION
    LASSO REGRESSION
    RIDGE REGRESSION
    DECISION TREE
    RANDOM FOREST
    XGBOOST
   ALSO TRIED ANN DEEP LEARNING ALGORITHM
   AND FINALLY TRIED TPOT AUTO ML CLASSIFIER
   THE BEST RESULT WERE GIVEN BY XGBOOST ALGORITHM
7. ALL THE AGORITHM USED IN THIS PROJECT WERE ALSO HYPERPARAMETER TUNED TO IMPROVE ACCURACY.
8. FINALLY I MADE SOME CONCLUSION WHICH CAN BE FOUND IN IPYNB NOTEBOOK OF THIS REPOSITORY.
